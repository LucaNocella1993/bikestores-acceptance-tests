# BIKESTORES-ACCEPTANCE-TEST
Boilerplate Microservice with automation testing of bikestores with Java 8 and Spring Boot useful to test the REST request of a microservice, in this case bikestores.

Please note that this is only a boilerplate microservice, there is not a defined business, many configurations and developments are forced to show all the different features of Spring Boot.

## Documentation
In order to deploy it, it is necessary only to create a database on SQL server, launch the scripts of the folder Documentation->SQL-Query 
(in order: create objects, load data, and Procedure Rename), and then create a user with the permission on that database with the username and password to overwrite 
in the file bikestores\src\main\resources\application-dev.properties. 

After that you have only to deploy with Spring Boot Application and the profile dev.

### Additional documentation in the repository
Under the path "bikestores/Documentation/" you can find:
- The folder "SQL-Query" with inside the SQL Queries used;
- The image of the UML of the database "SQL-Server-Sample-Database.png";
- The collection to import on postman with all the REST requests.
